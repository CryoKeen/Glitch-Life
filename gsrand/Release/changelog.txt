New Features (most of this stuff is configurable in gsrand_config.txt):
+ Model randomization finished (unstable)
+ Sprite randomization
+ Skybox randomization
+ Lots of new entity randomizations (a bit unstable)
+ BSP randomizations/corruptions (geometry + lighting + textures)
+ Sound effect randomization (reverb, pitch, etc.)
+ BSP model randomization (off by default)
+ Skill file generation (weapon/monster damage modifiers)
+ MOTD file generation (Helpful tips for new players)
+ RES file generation (for server hosters)
+ Non-default content is usable
+ Cheats via entities (no restrictions!)
+ Grapple weapon can attach to most walls
+ Configuration file added for advanced settings and map selection
+ Custom and timestamp map prefixes
+ "svencoop_downloads" is used for content selection
+ Textures embedded in maps are usable (lol porn)
+ Randomizations can be zipped if 7za.exe is present

Fixes:
