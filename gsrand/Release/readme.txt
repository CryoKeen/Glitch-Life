Place gsrand.exe in your SvenCoop folderand run it!

Or,

You can put gsrand in it's own folder and copy maps,
sounds, models, etc. next to it. This way you can
control what content gets used.


----------- Known Issues ---------------

Game crashes with this error: "Texture Overflow: MAX_GLTEXTURES"

This happens consistently when using model replacement. Just restart the game
and continue where you left off.


Game crashes with no error:

Probably caused by entity or model randomization. Re-running the randomizer
might fix the issue.
