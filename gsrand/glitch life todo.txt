glitch-life todo:

TEST: BSP model swapping origins
c1a0b white tex not all white
r_drawviewmodel 0
bsp model swap should be corruption setting
TEST: T model wasn't it res file for c1a0b
TEST: ammo not disappearing
TEST: gibshooters causing overflow
TEST: weapons not working for other player

Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
bypass all players must be inside  c1a4b c2a5b (c3a1a?) c3a1b
c1a2e (how did this changelevel ever work?)
dont make spinning things and doors take forever
better osprey replacements? Apache player model chance?
entity randomization configuration (modify chances/value ranges)
monster models aren't all actually monsters
replace { textures with random { textures (or just rename?)
weapon_strip for impulse 101?
combinable texture corruption

Flipping:
door directions messed up a bit (c4a1a, others)

scaling:
per-axis scaling (buggy, causes crash on c1a3 after shooting tripmine)

Future:
content creation (models, sprites, skyboxes, sounds?)
create randomized models (break bones, anims, textures, etc.)
custom map music? (e.g. moonlight sonata for greyscale tex mode)
