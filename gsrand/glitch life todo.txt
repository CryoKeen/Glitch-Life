glitch-life todo:

skybox replacement
player weapon v_ match p_  and w_ if super random?
global only model replacement (stability?)
allow non-default models/sounds/skyboxes (content selection option)
update help pages
read from map list instead of randomizing EVERYTHING
grapple hook if entity mode enabled but not texture mode
monster models aren't all actually monsters
external model blacklists/whitelists
separate player models from monster models

p_crowbar crash (sc_royals/pharoah.mdl)
hwgrunt crash ("models/hunger/thehand.mdl")
probably should just do thorough testing on each monster type...
37 -> 3 second compile from converting strings to char * (LOL wow..)

Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
bsp model swapping
make sure "specimen" in test chamber doesn't get jammed
bypass all players must be inside  c1a4b c2a5b (c3a1a?) c3a1b
c1a2e (how did this changelevel ever work?)
multiplayer packer (include non-default sounds/models/etc.)
res file generator for non-default stuff
dont make spinning things and doors take forever
player-model entites get shifted hull
equally random wad textrues
sometimes gsrand files not generated?
MOTD with useful tips and commands (cl_Stopsound, grapple gibbing)
better osprey replacements?
load textures from maps
user-defined voice directories
