glitch-life todo:

global only model replacement (stability?)
update help pages
read from map list instead of randomizing EVERYTHING
grapple hook if entity mode enabled but not texture mode
monster models aren't all actually monsters
external model blacklists/whitelists
pack everything into a zip when finished

probably should just do thorough testing on each monster type...

Nice-to-haves:

detailtextures?
bsp model swapping
make sure "specimen" in test chamber doesn't get jammed
bypass all players must be inside  c1a4b c2a5b (c3a1a?) c3a1b
c1a2e (how did this changelevel ever work?)
multiplayer packer (include non-default sounds/models/etc.)
dont make spinning things and doors take forever
equally random wad textrues
better osprey replacements?
load textures from maps
user-defined voice directories
game-text randomization
