model replacement bugs:

Nihilanth and cockroach can only be replaced with GMR

Replacing models for the following will cause a crash:
 - Nihilanth (immediate crash with many models, cause unknown)
 - controller (immediate crash with most models, cause unknown)
 - Apache (crashes when attacking enemy, model must have enough bone controllers)
 - Sentry (crashes when killed, model must have enough bone controllers)
 - player.mdl (many models work, switching certain weapons and going thirdperson causes it)
 - Kingpin (cause unknown, crash isn't immediate)
 - Tentacle (cause unknown, crash isn't immediate)
 - Any Monster (immediate crash if using a w_ model, probably due to w_svencoop_pickup.mdl)

GMR can cause a crash if a replacement model has been replaced in the same file. Example:
	"models/zombie.mdl" "models/rat.mdl"
        "models/barney.mdl" "models/zombie.mdl" ("Host no precache" error)
That example doesn't actually work, I forgot to write down the few cases where this happened

The game will crash if you are 1 model under the model limit (won't give you the 512 models error)
