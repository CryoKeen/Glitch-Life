model replacement bugs:

Nihilanth and cockroach can only be replaced with GMR

Replacing models for the following will cause a crash:
 - Nihilanth (immediate crash with many models, cause unknown)
 - controller (immediate crash with most models, cause unknown)
 - Apache (crashes when attacking enemy, model must have enough bone controllers)
 - Sentry (crashes when killed, model must have enough bone controllers)
 - player.mdl (many models work, switching certain weapons and going thirdperson causes it)
 - Kingpin (cause unknown, crash isn't immediate)
 - Tentacle (cause unknown, crash isn't immediate)
 - Any Monster (immediate crash if using a w_ model, probably due to w_svencoop_pickup.mdl)

There are many other monsters that will cause a crash when using the wrong model as a
replacement. The hwgrunt, for example, will crash if you use a model meant for a headcrab.
See model_blacklist.txt for more examples.

GMR can cause a crash if a replacement model has been replaced in the same file. Example:
	"models/w_grenade.mdl" "models/gman.mdl"
        "models/gman.mdl" "models/islave.mdl" 
The order of lines doesn't matter. This will cause "Host no precache: islave.mdl" error.
islave.mdl can be anything. Only certain models can take w_grenade's spot (e.g. w_uzi)

GMR can't find models with spaces in the file path (e.g. models/KscT/MasterChief Model/weapon/v_9mmAR.mdl)

The game will crash if you are 1 model under the model limit (won't give you the 512 models error)

Sprites will crash the game if both of the following conditions are met:
- The sprite format is "Normal" or "Additive"
- The number of pixels of any frame (Width x Height) is not divisible by 4 

After loading a lot of model/sprite textures (accumulated across level changes), 
the game will crash with this error: 'Texture Overflow: MAX_GLTEXTURES'. 

After loading a lot of models in general (accumulated across level changes)
the game will crash with no error or "Alloc Block: Full".

custom_precache will crash with certain models:
txas/servers.mdl
zombie_nights/zombie.mdl
