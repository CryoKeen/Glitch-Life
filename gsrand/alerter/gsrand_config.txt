// If set to "0" then the grapple will not be provided no matter what options are used.

// If set to "2", model replacement will be the same for every map.
// "0" is the least stable - you might crash after only about 2-6 map changes.
// "1" is fairly stable - you'll crash about every 6-12 map changes. 
// "2" is the most stable - but you'll still crash about every 20-40 map changes.
