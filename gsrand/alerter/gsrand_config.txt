// If gmr_only is set to "1" then model replacement will only occur via GMR files.
// If set to "0" then model replacement will also be done per-entity.
// It's generally safer to have this set to 1, and any model-related crashes
// can be fixed by editing/deleting the maps _gmr file. The trade-off is
// that all entities of the same type will use the same model (less random).

// If set to "0" then the grapple will not be provided no matter what options are used.

// or gibbing monsters that won't die or get out of the way due to their replacement model.
